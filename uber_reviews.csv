The driver gets distracted by the requests and has to take his hands off the wheel to return to the navigation screen. This is obviously very dangerous. Kindly rethink how and when drivers receive new requests especially when on a ride",3,0,4.548.10001,2024-10-24 09:35:02,,,4.548.10001

Then he neither doesn't come to the pick up point, nor he cancels or forwards my ride request. In such cases, my ride request gets stuck and it doesn't reach any other driver. And the driver who already accepted my request doesn't bother to come. So, I get stuck without any ride for indefinite amount of time. And Uber instead of compensating me for this irresponsible and evil behavior of the driver, rather cost me more money.",1,0,4.546.10002,2024-10-15 08:01:41,,,4.546.10002

Last 2 rides I was overcharged. First tike resolved in a satisfactory manner. Last ride ok Sept 12, was told it would cost $ 32.xx, Uber ended up charging me $59.02, tried dealing with their ABSOLUTELY, HORRIBLE support...was told I would be credited and provided with a $30 Uber cash credit..all they did was re charge the ride and paid it with the Uber cash, so now they've charged a total of $59.02 for a ride that should have cost $33",1,2,4.546.10002,2024-10-07 18:57:45,,,4.546.10002

He didn't stop and argued with me and told me to get out. I raised concern with the uber and they made a report that the rider was not comfortable with the service asked, like stopping for 5 seconds was uncomfortable.
