## Steps for Prioritizing Features

### 1. **Group Pain Points into Categories**
Using the insights from your analysis, the concerns can be grouped into broader categories:

- **App Functionality**
- **Driver Experience**
- **Pricing and Transparency**
- **Service and Support**
- **Wait Times and Cancellations**

### 2. **Assess Impact and Frequency**
Each pain point should be evaluated based on:
- **Frequency**: How often does this issue occur? (e.g., count of keywords, topics, or phrases)
- **Severity**: How critical is the issue? (e.g., negative impact on user retention or brand perception)
- **User Value**: How much will solving the issue improve the user experience?

### 3. **Use a Prioritization Framework**
To rank the features, you can use frameworks like **RICE** or **MoSCoW**:

#### A. **RICE Framework**
- **Reach**: How many users are impacted?
- **Impact**: How significant is the impact on the user experience? (1–3 scale, where 3 is high)
- **Confidence**: How confident are you in the data? (1–3 scale)
- **Effort**: How much effort (time/resources) is required to address it? (in person-hours/days)

##### Example Calculation:
\text{RICE Score} = \frac{\text{Reach} \times \text{Impact} \times \text{Confidence}}{\text{Effort}} ]

#### B. **MoSCoW Method**
- **Must Have**: Critical to fix (e.g., app crashes, payment issues).
- **Should Have**: High priority but not critical (e.g., pricing transparency).
- **Could Have**: Nice-to-have (e.g., new features like ride prediction).
- **Won’t Have**: Low ROI or too resource-intensive.

### 4. **Assign Priority Scores**
1. **App-related Issues**: Frequent mention of `app` suggests immediate action on bugs or usability.
2. **Driver-related Complaints**: Focus on driver training, feedback mechanisms, and accountability.
3. **Pricing**: Review fare algorithms and improve transparency.
4. **Service & Support**: Revamp customer support to address concerns promptly.
5. **Wait Times**: Optimize algorithms for driver allocation and user notifications.

### 5. **Visualize Priorities**
Create a **2x2 Priority Matrix** to visualize high-impact, low-effort issues:

| Impact  | Low Effort             | High Effort          |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------|
| High    | **Immediate Focus**    | **Plan Strategically** |
| Low     | **Quick Wins**         | **Deprioritize**     |
